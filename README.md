# About
This is my personal website that I start writing out of boredom.

I'm slowly contributing to it whenever I have time of fill like it.

Don't judge it too much, but I'd appreciate any feedback on bugs or ways to improve.

# Setting up
I'm sure you know how to run website locally, but that's a pesonal website. 
Just go to alexeyom.com if you want to see it live.

# Bug reporting
If you spot any bugs or have a cool idea on what to add, feel free to create an issue for this github repo.
